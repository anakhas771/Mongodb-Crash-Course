📘 MongoDB Crash Course

🚀 Overview

This repository contains everything I learned and practiced during my MongoDB Crash Course — from the absolute basics to performing real CRUD operations using the Mongo Shell, Compass, and Node.js.

It’s a hands-on guide for beginners who want to understand how MongoDB works as a NoSQL database and how to use it effectively in full-stack development.
